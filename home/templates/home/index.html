          <h2 class="text-center">Rooflight loft conversions and building regulations</h2><br>
          <p class="text-justify">Building regulations approval will always be needed when converting a loft. Although a rooflight loft conversion may not require planning permission, building regulations must be adhered to in order for 
              the conversion to go ahead. In order to receive a completion certificate, which is needed before work begins, a building control surveyor will come to the property to inspect the site and proposed project plans. Any type of 
              loft conversion must adhere to the following sections of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/contents/made" target="blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Building Regulations Act of 2010.</strong></a> It is your responsibility, before any work is undertaken, to check if you need planning permission.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">About us.</h2><br>
          <p class="text-justify">Since 1993, when we invented the original <strong>Conservation Rooflight</strong>, the company has been committed to designing and manufacturing <strong>high-quality rooflights</strong> 
            and providing quality of service to all our customers. We continually strive to innovate and develop our ranges by creating the minimalistic design aesthetic of the modern <strong>neo®</strong> range, 
            offering a <strong>bespoke design service </strong>and developing a top-performing, <strong>energy-efficient</strong> range of <strong>rooflights</strong>, <strong>neo Advance</strong>. 
            We were proud to announce that we became an Employee-Owned company in 2019 to secure the future of our business.  Learn more about our story and company values below.</p><br>
          <h2 class="text-center">Visions and Values</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">As an employee-owned business our vision is to be a Force for Good through our three Guiding Principles - Values-led Culture, 
            Innovation and Long-term Sustainability.  These principles guide future Trustees, Co-owners, the Co-owner Council and the Company Directors 
            in their decision making and activities.<br><br>
            There are four values within our Values-led Culture – Integrity, Care, Empowered and Unity, each with specific behaviours associated with those values.  
            It creates an atmosphere where personal growth is encouraged, nurtured and recognised.<br><br>
            With innovation, we strongly encourage new ideas and market-led thinking to design and make <strong>rooflights</strong> for the <strong>architectural building</strong> product market that 
            are novel, elegant and useful, continually balancing form and function.<br><br>
            Long-term sustainability in terms of growth and the environment means that we don’t accept quick fixes or unsustainable solutions. 
            We believe it’s our responsibility to play our part in mitigating climate change and we have an ambitious target of achieving zero waste to 
            landfill and being carbon neutral by 2026.</p>
