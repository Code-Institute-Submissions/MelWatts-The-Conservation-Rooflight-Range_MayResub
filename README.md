The ability to read, like and leave a comment on recent Customer Stories.

### SEO

SEO means Search Engine Optimization and is the process used to optimize a website's technical configuration, content relevance and link popularity so its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular towards user search queries, and as a consequence, search engines rank them better.

### Testing

## Testing Plan

Starting this project I know what my target audience would like to see on a website with buying a high end product as its topic. I took into consideration on what devices my users would like to see the website on. For testing I designed the website mobile first, with extensive testing using Chrome DevTools for all Iphone's. Using DevTools I continued testing the website using settings for the Ipad and a 15.6 inch laptop screen. For large screens I used a 24 inch monitor. I wanted my page to be seen in a horizontal manner on larger screens a vertical manner for small screens, and on medium sized screens I am aiming to be in the middle of these two.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

## First Time Visitor Goals

As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

* Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Shop now" Call to action button.
* The main points are made immediately with the navigation bar and call to action button.
* The user has the option to stay on the home page and read a bit about the company, click on the shop now button to take them to all products, create an account or filter throguh the products for their specific needs.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

* The site has been designed to be fluid and informative, easy to navigate. Each link describes what section the visitor will end up on.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want them to locate our social media links to see our following on social media to determine how trusted and known we are.
* As a First time visitor, I want them to sign up to our mailing list in the footer and recieve our monthly newsletr rearding the company and any new products.

* Once the new visitor has read through the site..
* The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate the social media links in the footer.

## Returning Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor, I want the visitor to find the where they were previously and feel confident to make the step to purchase.

* As a Returning Visitor, I want them to sign up to our newsletter via Mailchimp if they didn't as a new user.

* The home page clearly highlights the "Shop Now".

* Here they can fill out the form on the page or alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
* The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page.
* Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want them to find the Facebook Group link so that they can join and interact with others in the community.

* The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

## Frequent User Goals

As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added help, advice or new products.

* The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the call to action buttons or the navigation bar.
* As a Frequent User, I want them to check to see if there are any new infomation, stories to read or comments.
* The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the links to external sites.
* As a Frequent User, I want them to follow us on social media.

### Further Testing

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhone X.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all sections were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
* PEP8 code check for Python

### Implementation

Testing was mainly done using DevTools in google chrome. 
Starting mobile first then working my way up to bigger screen sizes. 
Whenever an element wasn't located where I wanted it to be I would use the `element.style` box in DevTools to find a solution. 

I used the WC3 code validators to check my code for mistakes as well. 

Testing is done in the following way: 

1. Scroll up and down the page checking for overflow and general positioning of items.
2. Use navigation bar to move to section of the page. 
3. In the form, try and click the button to check whether all fields are required to be filled in, check as well whether the e-mail part was set to e-mail.
4. Check all links in the footer whether they react as intended by opening in a new tab (for links section in footer). 
5. Run through all of these steps for each different screen size.
6. Use HTML and CSS validators from W3C schools to find mistakes in code.
7. Use PEP8 to validate my python code.
8. Use JShint to validate my JavaScript.
9. Use TestCase to test my Django
10. Jest to test my Javascript functions.


### Results

Once I had a general idea on how to run testing I followed all steps for each of my pages which gave me the following results:


* CSS-validator All Pags results: [media/CSSResults.JPG]

* PEP8 results: [media/PEP8Results.JPG]

* HTML Homepage results: [media/HTMLHomepageResults.JPG]
  * I will investigate further to why these errors have shown.

* HTML Product Page results: [media/HTMLProductPageResults.JPG]
  * I will investigate further to why these errors have shown.

* HTML Customer Story results: [media/HTMLCustomerStoriesResults.JPG]
  * I will investigate further to why these errors have shown.

* TestCase Django - I tried to follow the wakthrough to test my Django project, However I have ran out of time to conclude this process. I will investigate this further at a later date.

* Jest - I tried to follow the wakthrough to test my Django project, However I have ran out of time to conclude this process. I will investigate this further at a later date.

### Bugs need fixing
* Favicon icon isn't showing on all pages although in the head of my base.html
* Testing has been implemented but errors need further investigating. (I ran out of time I've had Covid - Sorry)
* Css for mailchimp isn't pulling through to heroku deployed version but is showing on my local server, css for this is in teh head of teh base.html.

#### Django 

I wasn't very confident in my Django project, therfore having to delete it all and starting again, after lots of tutor help and my fellow coders on slack I managed to successfully install my project for a story and log in log out funtion along with the function for teh logged in usedr to upload their own story and comment on others. Also following the, 'Boutique_ado', walkthrough helped massively.


## Deployment

This project is deployed using Heroku.
I used gitpod to write all code and seeing it is linked with github it was easy to use the terminal to commit.


## The project was deployed to Heroku

1. Log in to Heroku and create a new app
2. On the resources tab provision a new prostgres database.
3. Back in gitpod and install dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary.
4. Freeze the requirements.
5. Still in Gitpod, got to settings.py import dj_database_url, comment out the default configuration and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse, give it the database URL from Heroku by going to settings tab in Heroku and reveal Config Vars.
6. Show Migrations, check all is ok then migrate.
7. load data catergories first then load products.
8. Create superuser for Django
9. Delete the call to dj_database_url.parse, and comment back in the default configuration.
10. Create an 'if' statement in Settings.py so when the app is running on Heroku where the database URL environment variable will be defined.
11. Install Gunicorn then freeze this into requirements.
12. Create the Procfile to tell Heroku to create a web dyno. Which will run Gunicorn and serve our django app.
13. Temporarily disable collectstatic. use Heroku config set, disable collectstatic equals 1 using --app as I have more than one app.
14. Add allowed host name in settings.py plus local host.
15. Add and commit the changes in gitpod, git push heroku master to deploy to Heroku
16. Set to automatically deploy when pushed to github by going to Heroku app - deploy method set to Github, search for the repository, click connect. Finally enable automative deploy
17. Create a Secret key and add it to config variables in Heroku
18. Setting.py replace the Secret key setting with a call to get it from the environment and use an empty string.
19. Set DEBUG to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.
20. Commit and push to Github
21. Go to Heroku check the build is in progress and all is ok.


## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
